# 🌱 Seedling: Planting the Seeds of Financial Freedom

**Seedling** is a next-generation Fintech platform built on the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)**, designed to teach children financial discipline while building long-term generational wealth.

## 🚀 The Core Concept: The 70/30 Split
Seedling automates the habit of saving. Every time a child earns a reward for completing a chore, the app intelligently splits the assets:
- **70% Spend Seedling:** Available for immediate use, teaching kids budgeting and the value of labor.
- **30% Growth Seedling:** Automatically locked in a blockchain-backed escrow until the child turns 18.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Smart Escrow Rewards:** Parents can assign tasks and set rewards in XRP. Funds are secured via XRPL Smart Contracts.
- **Immutable Growth Fund:** The 30% portion is cryptographically locked, ensuring a dedicated fund for the child's future (Education/Business).
- **Gamified Experience:** A playful, kid-friendly UI that makes financial literacy fun and engaging.
- **Bank-Grade Security:** User data and seed phrases are protected using AES-256 encryption.
